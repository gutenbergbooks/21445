<h3>"THE SHEPHERD OF BANBURY'S WEATHER-RULES."</h3>

<p><em>The Shepherd of Banbury's Rules to judge of the Changes of the
Weather</em>, first printed in 1670, was long a favourite book with the
country gentleman, the farmer, and the peasant. They were accustomed to
regard it with the consideration and confidence which were due to the
authority of so experienced a master of the art of prognostication, and
dismissing every sceptical thought, received his maxims with the same
implicit faith as led them to believe that if their cat chanced to wash
her face, rainy weather would be the certain and inevitable result.
Moreover, this valuable little manual instructed them how to keep their
horses, sheep, and oxen sound, and prescribed cures for them when
distempered. No wonder, then, if it has passed through many editions.
Yet it has been invariably stated that <em>The Banbury Shepherd</em> in fact
had no existence; was purely an imaginary creation; and that the work
which passes under his name, "John Claridge," was written by Dr. John
Campbell, the Scottish historian, who died in 1775. The statements made
in connexion with this book are curious enough; and it is with a view of
placing the matter in a clear and correct light that I now trouble you
with a Note, which will, I hope, tend to restore to this poor
weather-wise old shepherd his long-lost rank and station among the rural
authors of England.</p>

<p>I believe that the source of the error is to be traced to the second
edition of the <em>Biographia Britannica</em>, in a memoir of Dr. Campbell by
Kippis, in which, when enumerating the works of the learned Doctor,
Kippis says, "He was also the author of <em>The Shepherd of Banbury's
Rules</em>,&mdash;a favourite pamphlet with the common people." We next find the
book down to Campbell as the "author" in Watt's <em>Bibliotheca
Britannica</em>, which is copied both by Chalmers and Lowndes. And so the
error has been perpetuated, even up to the time of the publication of a
meritorious <em>History of Banbury</em>, by the late Mr. Alfred Beesley, in
1841. This writer thus speaks of the work:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The far-famed shepherd of Banbury is only an apocryphal
personage. In 1744 there was published<span class='pagenum'><a id="page374" name="page374">{374}</a></span> <em>The Shepherd of
Banbury's Rules to judge of the Changes of the Weather, grounded
on forty Years' Experience. To which is added, a rational
Account of the Causes of such Alterations, the Nature of Wind,
Rain, Snow, &amp;c., on the Principles of the Newtonian Philosophy.
By John Claridge. London: printed for W. Bickerton, in the
Temple Exchange, Fleet Street. Price 1s.</em> The work attracted a
large share of public attention, and deserved it. A second
edition appeared in 1748.... It is stated in Kippis's
<em>Biographia Britannica</em> that, the real author was Dr. John
Campbell, a Scotchman."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1770 there appeared <em>An Essay on the Weather, with Remarks on "The
Shepherd of Banbury's Rules, &amp;c."</em>: by John Mills, Esq., F.R.S. Mr.
Mills observes:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Who the shepherd of Banbury was, we know not; nor indeed have
we any proof that the rules called his were penned by a real
shepherd. Both these points are, however, immaterial; their
truth is their best voucher.... Mr. Claridge published them in
the year 1744, since which time they are become very scarce,
having long been out of print."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now all these blundering attempts at annihilating the poor shepherd may,
I think, be accounted for by neither of the above-mentioned writers
having a knowledge of the original edition, published in 1670, of the
real shepherd's book (the title of which I will presently give), which
any one may see in the British Museum library. It has on the title-page
a slight disfigurement of name, viz. John <em>Clearidge</em>; but it is
<em>Claridge</em> in the Preface. The truth is, that Dr. John Campbell
<em>re-published</em> the book in 1744, but without affixing his own name, or
giving any information of its author or of previous editions. The part,
however, which he bore in this edition is explained by the latter
portion of the title already given; and still more clearly in the
Preface. We find authorities added, to give weight to the shepherd's
remarks; and likewise additional rules in relation to the weather,
derived from the common sayings and proverbs of the country people, and
from old English books of husbandry. It may, in short, be called a
clever scientific commentary on the shepherd's observations. After what
has been stated, your readers will not be surprised to learn that one
edition of the work appears in Watt's very inaccurate book under
<span class="smcap">Claridge</span>, another under <span class="smcap">Clearidge</span>, and a third under <span class="smcap">Campbell</span>. I will
now speak of the original work: it is a small octavo volume of
thirty-two pages, rudely printed, with an amusing Preface "To the
Reader," in which the shepherd dwells with much satisfaction on his
peculiar vaticinating talents. As this Preface has been omitted in all
subsequent editions, and as the book itself is extremely scarce, I
conceive that a reprint of it in your pages may be acceptable to your
Folk-lore readers. The "Rules" are interlarded with scraps of poetry,
somewhat after the manner of old Tusser, and bear the unmistakeable
impress of a "plain, unlettered Muse." The author concludes his work
with a poetical address "to the antiquity and honour of shepheards." The
title is rather a droll one, and is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Shepheard's Legacy: or John Clearidge his forty Years'
Experience of the Weather: being an excellent Treatise, wherein
is shewed the Knowledge of the Weather. First, by the Rising and
Setting of the Sun. 2. How the Weather is known by the Moon. 3.
By the Stars. 4. By the Clouds. 5. By the Mists. 6. By the
Rainbow. 7. And especially by the Winds. Whereby the Weather may
be exactly known from Time to Time: which Observation was never
heretofore published by any Author. 8. Also, how to keep your
Sheep sound when they be sound. 9. And how to cure them if they
be rotten. 10. Is shewed the Antiquity and Honour of Shepheards.
With some certain and assured Cures for thy Horse, Cow, and
Sheep.</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p>An Almanack is out at twelve months day,</p>
<p>My Legacy it doth endure for aye.</p>
<p>But take you notice, though 'tis but a hint,</p>
<p>It far excels some books of greater print.</p>
</div></div>

<p>London: printed and are to be sold by John Hancock, Junior, at
the Three Bibles in Popes-head Ally, next Cornhill, 1670."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the Preface he tells us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Having been importun'd by sundry friends (some of them being
worthy persons) to make publique for their further benefit what
they have found by experience to be useful for themselves and
others, I could not deny their requests; but was willing to
satisfie them, as also my own self, to do others good as well as
myself; lest I should hide my talent in a napkin, and my skill
be rak'd up with me in the dust. Therefore I have left it to
posterity, that they may have the fruit when the old tree is
dead and rotten. And because I would not be tedious, I shall
descend to some few particular instances of my skill and
foreknowledge of the weather, and I shall have done.</p>

<p>"First, in the year 1665, at the 1st of January, I told several
credible persons that the then frost would hold till March, that
men could not plow, and so it came to pass directly.</p>

<p>"2. I also told them that present March, that it would be a very
dry summer, which likewise came to pass.</p>

<p>"3. The same year, in November, I told them it would be a very
open winter, which also came to pass, although at that time it
was a great snow: but it lasted not a week.</p>

<p>"4. In the year 1666, I told them that year in March, that it
would be a very dry spring; which also came to pass.</p>

<p>"5. In the year 1667, certaine shepheards ask'd my councel
whether they might venture their sheep any more in the
Low-fields? I told them they might safely venture them till
August next; and they sped very well, without any loss.</p>

<p>"6. I told them, in the beginning of September the same year,
that it would be a south-west wind for two<span class='pagenum'><a id="page375" name="page375">{375}</a></span> or three months
together, and also great store of rain, so that wheat sowing
would be very difficult in the Low-fields, by reason of wet;
which we have found by sad experience. And further, I told them
that they should have not above three or four perfect fair days
together till the shortest day.</p>

<p>"7. In the year 1668, in March, although it was a very dry
season then, I told my neighbours that it would be an
extraordinary fruitful summer for hay and grass, and I knew it
by reason there was so much rain in the latter end of February
and beginning of March: for by that I ever judge of the summers,
and I look that the winter will be dry and frosty for the most
part, by reason that this November was mild: for by that I do
ever judge of the winters.</p>

<p>"Now, I refer you unto the book itself, which will sufficiently
inform you of sundry other of my observations. For in the
ensuing discourse I have set you down the same rules which I go
by myself. And if any one shall question the truth of what is
here set down, let them come to me, and I will give them further
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='author'>John Claridge, Sen.</p>

<p class='in2'>"Hanwell, near Banbury."</p></blockquote>

<p>It appears, from inquiries made in the neighbourhood, that the name of
Claridge is still common at Hanwell, a small village near Banbury&mdash;that
"land o'cakes,"&mdash;and that last century there was a John Claridge, a
small farmer, resident there, who died in 1758, and who might have been
a grandson of the "far-famed," but unjustly defamed, "shepherd of
Banbury."</p>

<p><em>Apropos</em> of the "cakes" for which this flourishing town has long been
celebrated, I beg to inform your correspondent <span class="smcap">Erica</span> (Vol. vii., p.
106.) and J. R. M., M.A. (p. 310.) that there is a receipt "how to make
a very good Banbury cake," printed as early as 1615, in Gervase
Markham's <em>English Hus-wife</em>.</p>

<p><em>To miss</em>, to dispense with. This usage of the verb being of such
ordinary occurrence, I should have deemed it superfluous to illustrate,
were it not that the editors of Shakspeare, according to custom, are at
a loss for examples:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i0'>"We cannot <em>miss</em> him."</p>
</div></div>

<p class='in2'><em>The Tempest</em>, Act I. Sc. 2. (where see Mr. Collier's note, and
also Mr. Halliwell's, Tallis's edition).</p>

<p>"All which things being much admirable, yet this is most, that
they are so profitable; bringing vnto man both honey and wax,
each so wholesome that we all desire it, both so necessary that
we cannot <em>misse</em> them."&mdash;<em>Euphues and his England.</em></p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i0'>"I will have honest valiant souls about me;</p>
<p>I cannot <em>miss</em> thee."</p>
</div></div>

<p class='in2'>Beaumont and Fletcher, <em>The Mad Lover</em>, Act II. Sc. 1.</p>


<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i0'>"The blackness of this season cannot <em>miss</em> me."</p>
</div></div>

<p class='in2'>The second <em>Maiden's Tragedy</em>, Act V. Sc. 1.</p>

<p>"All three are to be had, we cannot <em>miss</em> any of them."&mdash;Bishop
Andrewes, "A Sermon prepared to be preached on Whit Sunday, <small>A.D.</small>
1622," <em>Library of Ang.-Cath. Theology</em>, vol. iii. p. 383.</p>

<p>"For these, for every day's dangers we cannot <em>miss</em> the
hand."&mdash;"A Sermon preached before the King's Majesty at
Burleigh, near Oldham, <small>A.D.</small> 1614," <em>Id.</em>, vol. iv. p. 86.</p>

<p>"We cannot <em>miss</em> one of them; they be necessary all."&mdash;<em>Id.</em>,
vol. i. p. 73.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is hardly necessary to occupy further room with more instances of so
familiar a phrase, though perhaps it may not be out of the way to
remark, that <em>miss</em> is used by Andrewes as a substantive in the same
sense as the verb, namely, in vol. v. p. 176.: the more usual form being
<em>misture</em>, or, earlier, <em>mister</em>. Mr. Halliwell, in his <em>Dictionary</em>,
most unaccountably treats these two forms as distinct words; and yet,
more unaccountably, collecting the import of <em>misture</em> for the context,
gives it the signification of misfortune!! He quotes Nash's <em>Pierce
Pennilesse</em>; the reader will find the passage at p. 47. of the
Shakspeare Society's reprint. I subjoin another instance from vol. viii.
p. 288. of Cattley's edition of Foxe's <em>Acts and Monuments</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Therefore all men evidently declared at that time, both how
sore they took his death to heart; and also how hardly they
could away with the <em>misture</em> of such a man."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Latin, <em>desidero</em> and <em>desiderium</em> best convey the import of this
word.</p>

<p><em>To buckle</em>, bend or bow. Here again, to their great discredit be it
spoken, the editors of Shakspeare (Second Part of <em>Hen. IV.</em>, Act I. Sc.
1.) are at fault for an example. Mr. Halliwell gives one in his
<em>Dictionary</em> of the passive participle, which see. In Shakspeare it
occurs as a neuter verb:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i8'>"... And teach this body,</p>
<p>To bend, and these my aged knees to <em>buckle</em>,</p>
<p>In adoration and just worship to you."</p>
<p class='i2'>Ben Jonson, <em>Staple of News</em>, Act II. Sc. 1.</p>
</div></div>



<p>"For, certainly, like as great stature in a natural body is some
advantage in youth, but is but burden in age: so it is with
great territory, which, when a state beginneth to decline, doth
make it stoop and <em>buckle</em> so much the faster."&mdash;Lord Bacon, "Of
the True Greatness of Great Britain," vol. i. p. 504. (Bohn's
edition of the <em>Works</em>).</p></blockquote>

<p>And again, as a transitive verb:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sear trees, standing or felled, belong to the lessee, and you
have a special replication in the book of 44 E. III., that the
wind did but rend them and <em>buckle</em> them."&mdash;<em>Case of Impeachment
of Waste</em>, vol. i. p. 620.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>On the hip</em>, at advantage. A term of wrestling. So said Dr. Johnson at
first; but, on second<span class='pagenum'><a id="page376" name="page376">{376}</a></span> thoughts, referred it to <em>venery</em>, with which Mr.
Dyce consents: both erroneously. Several instances are adduced by the
latter, in his <em>Critique of Knight and Collier's Shakspeare</em>; any one of
which, besides the passage in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, should have
confuted that origin of the phrase. The hip of a chase is no term of
woodman's craft: the haunch is. Moreover, what a marvellous expression,
to say, A hound has a chase <em>on</em> the hip, instead of <em>by</em>. Still more
prodigious to say, that a hound <em>gets</em> a chase <em>on</em> the hip. One would
be loth to impute to the only judicious dramatic commentator of the day,
a love of contradiction as the motive for quarrelling with Mr. Collier's
note on this idiom. To the examples alleged by Mr. Dyce, the three
following may be added; whereof the last, after the opinion of Sir John
Harington, rightly refers the origin of the metaphor to wrestling:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Divell hath them <em>on the hip</em>, he may easily bring them to
anything."&mdash;<em>Michael and the Dragon</em>, by D. Dike, p. 328.
(<em>Workes</em>, London, 1635).</p>

<p>"If he have us at the advantage, <em>on the hip</em> as we say, it is
no great matter then to get service at our hands."&mdash;Andrewes, "A
Sermon preached before the King's Majesty at Whitehall, 1617,"
<em>Library of Ang.-Cath. Theology</em>, vol. iv. p. 365.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a id='Lord_Coke' name='Lord_Coke'>LORD COKE.</a></h3>

<p>Turning over some old books recently, my attention was strongly drawn to
the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Lord Coke, his Speech and Charge, with a Discouerie of the
Abuses and Corruptions of Officers. 8vo. Lond. N. Butter, 1607."</p></blockquote>

<p>This curious piece appears to have been published by one R. P.
<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, who
describes himself, in his dedication to the Earl of Exeter, as a "poore,
dispised, pouertie-stricken, hated, scorned, and vnrespected souldier,"
of which there were, doubtless, many in the reign of James the Pacific.
Lord Coke, in his address to the jury at the Norwich Assizes, gives an
account of the various plottings of the Papists, from the Reformation to
the Gunpowder Treason, to bring the land again under subjection to Rome,
and characterises the schemes and the actors therein as he goes along in
the good round terms of an out-and-out Protestant. He has also a fling
at the Puritans, and all such as would disturb the church and hierarchy
as by law established. But the most remarkable part of the book is that
which comes under the head of "A Discouerie of the Abuses and Corruption
of Officers;" and believing an abstract might interest your readers, and
furnish the antiquary with a reference, I herewith present you with a
list of the officials and others whom my Lord Coke recommends the
<em>Jurie</em> to present, assuring them, at the same time, that "by God's
grace they, the offenders, shall not goe unpunished for their abuses;
for we have," says he, "a <small>COYFE</small>, which signifies a <em>scull</em>, whereby, in
the execution of justice, wee are defended against all oppositions, bee
they never so violent."</p>

<p>1. The first gentleman introduced by Lord Coke to the Norwich jury is
the <em>Escheator</em>, who had power to demand upon what tenure a poor yeoman
held his lands, and is an officer in great disfavour with the judge. He
gives some curious instances of his imposition, and concludes by
remarking that, for his rogueries, he were better described by striking
away the first syllable of his name, the rest truly representing him a
<em>cheator</em>.</p>

<p>2. <em>The Clarke of the Market</em> comes in for his share of Lord Coke's
denouncements. "It was once," he says, "my hap to take a clarke of the
market in his trickes; but I aduanst him higher than his father's sonne,
by so much as from the ground to the toppe of the pillorie" for his
bribery.</p>

<p>3. "A certaine ruffling officer" called a <em>Purveyor</em>, who is
occasionally found <em>purveying money</em> out of your purses, and is
therefore, says Lord Coke, "on the highway to the gallowes."</p>

<p>4. As the next officer is unknown in the present day, I give his
character <em>in extenso</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is also a Salt-peter-man, whose commission is not to
break vp any man's house or ground without leaue. And not to
deale with any house, but such as is vnused for any necessarie
imployment by the owner. And not to digge in any place without
leauing it smooth and leuell: in such case as he found it. This
Salt-peter-man vnder shew of his authoritie, though being no
more than is specified, will make plaine and simple people
beleeue, that hee will without their leaue breake vp the floore
of their dwelling house, vnlesse they will compound with him to
the contrary. Any such fellow, if you can meete with all, let
his misdemenor be presented, that he may be taught better to
vnderstand his office: For by their abuse the country is
oftentimes troubled."</p></blockquote>

<p>5. There is another troublesome fellow called a <em>Concealor</em>, who could
easily be proved no better<span class='pagenum'><a id="page377" name="page377">{377}</a></span> than a <em>cosioner</em>, and whose pretensions are
to be resisted.</p>

<p>6. A <em>Promoter</em>, generally both a beggar and a knave. This is the modern
informer, "a necessarie office," says Lord Coke, "but rarely filled by
an honest man."</p>

<p>7. The <em>Monopolitane</em> or <em>Monopolist</em>; with these the country was
overrun in James' reign. "To annoy and hinder the public weale, these
for their own benefit have sold their lands, and then come to beggarie
by a <em>starch</em>, <em>vinegar</em>, or <em>aqua vit&aelig;</em> monopoly, and justly too," adds
his lordship.</p>

<p>8. Lord Coke has no objection to those <em>golden fooles</em>, the <em>Alcumists</em>,
so long as they keep to their <em>metaphisicall</em> and <em>Paracelsian</em> studies;
but <em>science is felony committed by any comixture to multiply either
gold or silver</em>; the alchymist is therefore a suspected character, and
to be looked after by the jury.</p>

<p>9. Vagrants to be resolutely put down, the Statute against whom had
worked well.</p>

<p>10. The stage-players find no favour with this stern judge, who tells
the jury that as they, the players, cannot perform without leave, it is
easy to be rid of them, remarking, <em>that the country is much troubled by
them</em>.</p>

<p>11. Taverns, Inns, Ale-houses, Bowling Allies, and such like thriftless
places of resort for tradesmen and artificers, to be under strict
surveillance.</p>

<p>12. Gallants, or riotous young gents, to be sharply looked after, and
their proceedings controlled.</p>

<p>13. Gentlemen with greyhounds and birding-pieces, who would elude the
<em>statutes against gunnes</em>, to be called to account "for the
shallow-brain'd idlenesse of their ridiculous foolery."</p>

<p>14. The statute against <em>ryotous expence in apparel</em> to be put in force
against <em>unthriftie infractors</em>.</p>

<p>There is room here for a few Queries, but I content myself with asking
for a further reference to No. 4., "The Salt-peter-man."</p>

<p><em>Dogberry's Losses or Leases.</em>&mdash;<em>Much Ado about Nothing</em>, Act IV. Sc.
4.:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<em>Dogberry.</em> A rich fellow enough, go to: and a fellow that hath
had losses; and one that hath two gowns, and everything handsome
about him."</p></blockquote>

<p>I can quite sympathise with the indignation of some of my cotemporaries
at the alteration by <span class="smcap">Mr. Payne Collier's</span> mysterious corrector, of
"losses" into "leases." I am sorry to see a reading which we had
cherished without any misgiving as a bit of Shaksperian quaintness, and
consecrated by the humour of Gray and Charles Lamb, turned into a clumsy
misprint. But we must look at real probabilities, not at fancies and
predilections. I am afraid "leases" is the likelier word. It has also a
special fitness, which has not been hitherto remarked. Many of the
wealthy people of Elizabeth's reign, particularly in the middle class,
were "fellows that had had leases." It will be recollected that
extravagant leases or fines were among the methods by which the
possessions of the church were so grievously dilapidated in the age of
the Reformation. Those who had a little money to invest, could not do so
on more advantageous terms than by obtaining such leases as the
necessity or avarice of clerical and other corporations induced them to
grant; and the coincident fall in the value of money increased the gain
of the lessees, and loss of the corporations, to an extraordinary
amount. Throughout Elizabeth's reign parliament was at work in
restraining this abuse, by the well-known "disabling acts," restricting
the power of bishops and corporations to lease their property. The last
was passed, I think, only in 1601. And therefore a "rich fellow" of
Dogberry's class was described, to the thorough comprehension and
enjoyment of an audience of that day, as one who "had <em>had</em> leases."</p>

<p>May I be allowed a little space in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." to draw <span class="smcap">Mr.
Collier's</span> attention to some passages in which the old corrector appears
to me to have corrupted, rather than improved, the text? Possibly on
second thoughts <span class="smcap">Mr. Collier</span> may be induced to withdraw these readings
from the text of his forthcoming edition of our great poet. I give the
pages of <span class="smcap">Mr. Collier's</span> recent volume, and quote according to the old

</div></div>

<p><em>Can</em> for <em>am</em> spoils the sense; it was introduced unnecessarily to make
a perfect rhyme, but such rhymes as <em>am</em> and <em>man</em> were common in
Shakspeare's time. <em>Loving</em> for <em>lovely</em> is another modernism; <em>lovely</em>
is equivalent to the French <em>aimable</em>. "Saul and Jonathan were <em>lovely</em>
and pleasant in their lives," &amp;c. The whole passage, which is indeed
faulty in the old copies, should, I think, be read thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i8'>"'Tis a passing shame</p>

</div></div>

<p>When fathers kill their children, they run the risk not merely of being
reproached, but of being hanged; but this reading is a mere
sophistication by some one who did not understand the true reading,
<em>rearward</em>. Leonato threatens to take his daughter's life <em>after having</em>
reproached her.</p>

<p>Such as the daughter of <em>Agenor's race</em>," &amp;c.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"The daughter of Agenor's race" for "the daughter of Agenor" is awkward,
but there is a far more decisive objection to this alteration. To
compare the beauty of Bianca with the beauty of Europa is a legitimate
comparison; but to compare the beauty of Bianca with Europa herself, is
of course inadmissible. Here is another corruption introduced in order
to produce rhyming couplet; restore the old reading, "the daughter of
Agenor <em>had</em>."</p>

</div></div>

<p>We have here an abortive attempt to correct the nonsensical reading of
the old copies, <em>unrolled</em>; but if <em>enrolled</em> itself makes sense, it
does so only by introducing tautology. Besides, it leads us away from
what I believe to be the true reading, <em>unrogued</em>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>How could death prey upon the king's outward parts without visiting
them? Perhaps, however, we have here only a corruption of a genuine
text. Query, "<em>ill</em>-visited."</p>

<p>Replies to chiding fortune."</p>
</div></div>

<p>This, which is also Hanmer's reading, certainly makes sense. Pope read
<em>returns</em>. The old copies have <em>retires</em>. I believe Shakspeare wrote
"<em>Rechides</em> to chiding fortune." This puzzled the compositor, who gave
the nearest common word without regard to the sense.</p>

<p><em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, Act V. Sc. 1., p. 342.&mdash;The disgusting speeches
of Thersites are scarcely worth correcting, much less dwelling upon; but
there can be little doubt that we should read "male <em>harlot</em>" for "male
<em>varlet</em>;" and "preposterous <em>discoverers</em>" (not discolourers) for
"preposterous discoveries."</p>

<p class='in2'><em>Coriolanus</em>, Act V. Sc. 5., p. 364.:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i0'>"I ... holp to reap the fame</p>
<p>Which he did <em>ear</em> all his."</p>
</div></div>

<p>To <em>ear</em> is to <em>plough</em>. Aufidius complains that he had a share in the
harvest, while Coriolanus took all the ploughing to himself. We have
only, however, to transpose <em>reap</em> and <em>ear</em>, and this nonsense is at
once converted into excellent sense. The old corrector blindly copied
the blunder of a corrupt, but not sophisticated, manuscript. This has
occurred elsewhere in this collection.</p>

<p class='in2'><em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>, Act I. Sc. 5., p. 467.:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i0'>"And soberly did mount an <em>arm-girt</em> steed."</p>
</div></div>

<p>This reading was also conjectured by Hanmer. The folios read
<em>arme-gaunt</em>. This appears to me a mere misprint for <em>rampaunt</em>, but
whether <em>rampaunt</em> was Shakspeare's word, or a transcriber's
sophistication for <em>ramping</em>, is more than I can undertake to determine.
I believe, however, that one of them is the true reading. At one period
to <em>ramp</em> and to <em>prance</em> seem to have been synonymous. Spenser makes

<p><em>Mr. Collier's "Notes and Emendations:" Passage in "The Winter's
Tale."</em>&mdash;At p. 192. of <span class="smcap">Mr. Payne Collier's</span> new volume, he cites a
passage in <em>The Winter's Tale</em>, ending&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i7'>"... I should blush</p>
<p>To see you so attir'd, sworn, I think</p>
<p>To show myself a glass."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The MS. emendator, he says, reads <em>so worn</em> for <em>sworn</em>; and adds:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The meaning therefore is, that Florizel's plain attire was 'so
worn,' to show Perdita, as in a glass, how simply she ought to
have been dressed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now <span class="smcap">Mr. Collier</span>, in this instance, has not, according to his usual
practice, alluded to any commentator who has suggested the same
emendation. The inference would be, that this emendation is a novelty.
This it is not. It has been before the world for thirty-four years, and
its merits have failed to give it currency. At p. 142. of Z. Jackson's
miscalled <em>Restorations</em>, 1819, we find this emendation, with the
following note:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<em>So worn</em>, i. e. <em>so reduced</em>, in your external appearance,
that I should think you intended to remind me of my own
condition; for, by looking at you thus attired, I behold myself,
as it were, reflected in a glass, habited in robes becoming my
obscure birth, and equally obscure fortune."</p></blockquote><p><span class='pagenum'><a id="page379" name="page379">{379}</a></span></p>

<p>Jackson's emendations are invariably bad; but whatever may be thought of
the sense of Florizel being <em>so worn</em> (instead of his dress), it is but
fair to give a certain person his due. The passage has long seemed to me
to have this meaning:</p>

<blockquote><p>"But that we are acquiescing in a custom, I should blush to see
you, who are a prince, attired like a swain; and still more
should I blush to look at myself in the glass, and see a peasant
girl pranked up like a princess."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>&amp; more</em>, in MS., might very easily have been mistaken for <em>sworn</em> by
the compositor. Accordingly, I would read the complete passage thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i7'>"... But that our feasts</p>
<p>In every mess have folly, and the feeders</p>
<p>Digest it with a custom, I should blush</p>
<p>To see you so attir'd, and more, I think,</p>
<p>To show myself a glass."</p>

<p><em>Suggested Reprint of Hearne.</em>&mdash;It has often occurred to me to inquire
whether an association might not be formed for the republication of the
works edited by Tom Hearne? An attempt was made some years ago by a
bookseller; and, as only Robert of Gloucester and Peter Langtoft
appeared, "Printed for Samuel Bagster, in the Strand, 1810," we must
infer that the spirited publisher was too far in advance of the age, and
that the attempt did not pay. Probably it never would <em>as a bookseller's
speculation</em>. But might not a society like the Camden be formed for the
purpose with some probability, in these altered times and by such an
improved method of proceeding, of placing these curious and valuable
volumes once more within reach of men of ordinary means? At present the
works edited by Hearne are rarely to be met with in catalogues, and when
they do occur, the prices are almost fabulous, quite on the scale of
those affixed to ancient MSS.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id="page380" name="page380">{380}</a></span><em>Derivation of "Canada."</em>&mdash;I send you a cutting from an old newspaper,
on the derivation of this word:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The name of Canada, according to Sir John Barrow, originated in
the following circumstances. When the Portuguese, under Gasper
Cortcreal, in the year 1500, first ascended the great river St.
Lawrence, they believed it was the strait of which they were in
search, and through which a passage might be discovered into the
Indian Sea. But on arriving at the point whence they could
clearly ascertain it was not a strait but a river, they, with
all the emphasis of disappointed hopes, exclaimed repeatedly
'Canada!'&mdash;Here nothing; words which were remembered and
repeated by the natives on seeing Europeans arrive in 1534, who
naturally conjectured that the word they heard employed so often
must denote the name of the country."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Railway Signals.</em>&mdash;An effective communication from the guard to the
engineman, for the prevention of railway accidents, seems to be an
important desideratum, which has hitherto baffled the ingenuity of
philosophers. The only proposed plan likely to be adopted, is that of a
cord passing below the foot-boards, and placing the valve of the steam
whistle under the control of the guard. The trouble attending this
scheme, and the liability to neglect and disarrangement, render its
success doubtful. What I humbly suggest is, that the guard should be
provided with an independent instrument which would produce a sound
sufficiently loud to catch the ear of the engineman. Suppose, for
instance, that the mouth-piece of a clarionet, or the windpipe of a
duck, or a metallic imitation, were affixed to the muzzle of an air-gun,
and the condensed air discharged through the confined aperture; a shrill
sound would be emitted. Surely, then, a small instrument might be
contrived upon this principle, powerful enough to arrest the attention
of the engineer, if not equal to the familiar shriek of the present
whistle.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this hint will be followed up; that your publication
will sustain its character by thus providing a medium of
intercommunication for these worthies, who can respectively lay claim to
the titles of men of science and men of <em>letters</em>, and that some
experimenter "when found will make a <em>note</em>"&mdash;a stunning one.</p>

<h3>BISHOP KEN.</h3>

<p>At what place, and by what bishop, was he ordained, in 1661? His
ordination probably took place in the diocese of Oxford, London,
Winchester, or Worcester. The discovery of it has hitherto baffled much
research.</p>

<p>Jon Ken, an elder brother of the Bishop, was Treasurer of the East India
Company in 1683. Where can anything be learned of him? Is there any
mention of him in the books of the East India Company? Was he the Ken
mentioned in Roger North's <em>Lives of the Norths</em>, as one of the
court-rakes? When did he die, and where was he buried? This Jon Ken
married Rose, the daughter of Sir Thomas Vernon, of Coleman Street, and
by her is said (by Hawkins) to have had a daughter, married to the
Honorable Christopher Frederick Kreienberg, Hanoverian Resident in
London. Did M. Kreienberg die in this country, or can anything be
ascertained of him or his wife?</p>

<p>The Bishop wrote to James II. a letter of intercession on behalf of the
rebels in 1685. Can this letter be found in the State-Paper Office, or
elsewhere?</p>

<p>In answer to a sermon preached by Bishop Ken, on 5th May, 1687, one F.
I. R., designating himself "a most loyal Irish subject of the <em>Company
of Jesuits</em>," wrote some "Animadversions." Could this be the "fath. Jo.
Reed," a <em>Benedictine</em>, mentioned in the Life of A. Wood, under date of
July 21, 1671? Father Reed was author of <em>Votiva Tabula</em>. Can any one
throw any light on this?</p>

lady of Sir Samuel Cromwell, and other persons.... They were
executed, and their goods, which were of the value of forty
pounds, being escheated to Sir S. Cromwell, as lord of the
manor, he gave the amount to the mayor and aldermen of
Huntingdon, for a rent-charge of forty shillings yearly, to be
paid out of their town lands, for an annual lecture upon the
subject of witchcraft, to be preached at their town every
Lady-Day, by a doctor or bachelor of divinity, of Queen's

<h3>GRUB STREET JOURNAL.</h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. vii., pp. 108. 268.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reginensis</span> has been referred by F. R. A. to Drake's <em>Essays</em> for an
account of this journal. Drake's account is, however, very incorrect.
The <em>Grub Street Journal</em> did not terminate, as he states, on the 24th
August, 1732, but was continued in the original folio size to the 29th
Dec., 1737; the last No. being 418., instead of 138., as he incorrectly
gives it. He appears to have supposed that the 12mo. abridgment in two
volumes contained all the essays in the paper; whereas it did not
comprise more than a third of them. He mentions as the principal writers
Dr. Richard Russel and Dr. John Martyn. Budgell, however, in <em>The Bee</em>
(February, 1733) says, "The person thought to be at the head of the
paper is Mr. R&mdash;l (Russel), a nonjuring clergyman, Mr. P&mdash;e (Pope), and
some other gentlemen." Whether Pope wrote in it or not, it seems to have
been used as a vehicle by his friends for their attacks upon his foes,
and the war against the Dunces is carried on with great wit and spirit
in its pages. It is by far the most entertaining of the old newspapers,
and throws no small light upon the literary history of the time. I have
a complete series of the journal in folio, as well as of the
continuation, in a large 4to. form, under the title of <em>The Literary
Courier of Grub Street</em>, which commenced January 5, 1738, and appears to
have terminated at the 30th No., on the 27th July, 1738. I never saw
another complete copy. <em>The Grub Street Journal</em> would afford materials
for many curious and amusing extracts. One very entertaining part of it
is the "Domestic News," under which head it gives the various and often
contradictory accounts of the daily newspapers, with a most humorous
running commentary.</p>

<h3><a id='Stone_Pillar_Worship' name='Stone_Pillar_Worship'>STONE PILLAR WORSHIP.</a></h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. v., p. 122.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir James Emerson Tennent</span>, in his learned and curious Note on stone
worship in Ireland, desires information as to the present existence of
worship of stone pillars in Orkney. When he says it continued till a
late period, I suppose he must allude to the standing stone at Stenness,
perforated by a hole, with the sanctity attached to promises confirmed
by the junction of hands through the hole, called the promise of Odin.
Dr. Daniel Wilson enters into this fully in <em>Pr&aelig;historic Annals of
Scotland</em>, pp. 99, 100, 101. It has been told myself that if a lad and
lass promised marriage with joined hands through the hole, the promise
was held to be binding. Whence the sanctity attached to such a promise I
could not ascertain to be known, and I did not hear of any other
superstition connected with this stone, which was destroyed in 1814. In
the remote island of North Ronaldshay is another standing stone,
perforated by a hole, but there is no superstition of this nature
attached to it. At the Yule time the inhabitants danced about it, and
when there were yule dancings in neighbouring houses, they began the
dancing at the stone, and danced from the stone all the road to what was
called to<span class='pagenum'><a id="page384" name="page384">{384}</a></span> me the dancing-house. The sword dance, with a great deal of
intricate crossing, and its peculiar simple tune, still exists in
Orkney, but is not danced with swords, though I heard of clubs or sticks
having been substituted. There are found in these islands the two
circles of stones at Stenness, and single standing stones. One of these,
at Swannay in Birsay, is said by tradition to have been raised to mark
the spot where the procession rested when carrying the body of St.
Magnus after his murder in Egilshay in 1110, from that island to
Christ's Kirk in Birsay, where it was first interred. Here is a date and
a purpose. The single standing stones, in accordance with <span class="smcap">Sir James's</span>
opinion, and to use nearly his expressions, are said to mark the
burial-places of distinguished men, to commemorate battles and great
events, and to denote boundaries; and these, and still more the circles,
are objects of respect as belonging to ages gone by, but principally
with the educated classes, and there is no superstition remaining with
any. Such a thing as the swathing stone of South Inchkea is not known to
have existed. The stones in the two circles, and the single standing
stones, are all plain; but there was found lately a stone of the
sculptured symbolical class, inserted to form the base of a window in
St. Peter's Kirk, South Ronaldshay, and another of the same class in the
island of Bressay, in Zetland. The first is now in the Museum of
Scottish Antiquaries in Edinburgh; and the Zetland stone, understood to
be very curious, is either there or in Newcastle, and both are forming
the subject of antiquarian inquiry.</p>

engraving of a stone of Cranmer's father, with the fusils on his right,
and Cranmer on his left. The note at p. 991. calls the birds cranes, but
states that Glover's Yorkshire and other pedigrees have pelicans; and
Southey (<em>Book of the Church</em>, ii. p. 97.) states that Henry VIII.
altered the cranes to pelicans, telling him that he, like them, should
be ready to shed his blood. The engraving, however, clearly represents
drops of blood falling, and those in the Bible appear to be pelicans
also.</p>

<h3><a id='Grindle' name='Grindle'>GRINDLE.</a></h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. vii., pp. 107. 307.)</p>

<p>I think I can supply I. E. with another example of the application of
this name to a place. A few miles east or south-east of Exeter, on the
borders of a waste tract of down extending from Woodbury towards the
sea, there is a village which is spelt on the ordnance map, and is
commonly called, <em>Greendale</em>. In strictness there are, I believe, two
Greendales, an upper and a lower Greendale. A small stream, tributary to
the Clyst river, flows past them.</p>

<p>Now this place formerly belonged to the family of Aumerle, or Alba
Marla, as part of the manor of Woodbury. From that family it passed to
William Briwere, the founder of Tor Abbey, and was by him made part of
the endowment of that monastery in the reign of Richard I. In the two
cartularies of that house, of which abstracts will be found in Oliver's
<em>Monasticon</em>, there are many instruments relating to this place, which
is there called Grendel, Grindel, and Gryndell. In none of them does the
name of Greendale occur, which appears to be a very recent form. Even
Lysons, in his <em>Devonshire</em>, does not seem to be aware of this mode of
spelling it, but always adopts one of the old ways of writing the word.</p>

<p>I have not seen the spot very lately, but, according to the best of my
recollection, it has not now any feature in keeping with the
mythological character of the fiend of the moor and fen. The
neighbouring district of down and common land would not be an
inappropriate habitat for such a personage. It has few trees of any
pretension to<span class='pagenum'><a id="page385" name="page385">{385}</a></span> age, and is still covered in great part with a dark and
scanty vegetation, which is sufficiently dreary except at those seasons
when the brilliant colours of the blooming heath and dwarf furze give it
an aspect of remarkable beauty.</p>

<p>Whether the present name of Greendale be a mere corruption of the
earliest name, or be not, in fact, a restoration of it to its original
meaning, is a matter which I am not prepared to discuss. As a general
rule, a sound etymologist will not hastily desert an obvious and trite
explanation to go in search of a more recondite import. He will not have
recourse to the devil for the solution of a <em>nodus</em>, till he has
exhausted more legitimate sources of assistance.</p>

<p>The "N. &amp; Q." have readers nearer to the spot in question than I am, who
may, perhaps, be able to throw some light on the subject, and inform us
whether Greendale still possesses the trace of any of those natural
features which would justify the demoniacal derivation proposed by I. E.
It must not, however, be forgotten that three centuries and a half of
laborious culture bestowed upon the property by the monks of Tor, must
have gone far to exorcise and reclaim it.</p>

<p class='author'>E. S.</p>


<p>Some years ago I asked the meaning of <em>Grindle</em> or <em>Grundle</em>, as applied
to a deep, narrow watercourse at Wattisfield in Suffolk. The Grundle
lies between the high road and the "Croft," adjoining a mansion which
once belonged to the Abbots of Bury. The clear and rapid water was
almost hidden by brambles and underwood; and the roots of a row of fine
trees standing in the Croft were washed bare by its winter fury. The
bank on that side was high and broken; the bed of the Grundle I observed
to lie above the surface of the road, on the opposite side of which the
ground rises rapidly to the table land of clay. My fancy instantly
suggested a river flowing through this hollow, and the idea was
strengthened by the appearance of the landscape. The village stands on
irregular ground, descending by steep slopes into narrow valleys and
contracted meadows. I can well imagine that water was an enemy or
"fiend" to the first settlers, and I was told that in winter the Grundle
is still a roaring brook.</p>

<p>I find I have a Note that "in Charters, places bearing the name Grendel
are always connected with water."</p>

<h3><a id='Roger_Outlawe' name='Roger_Outlawe'>ROGER OUTLAWE.</a></h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. vii., p. 332.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ellacombe</span> will find some account of this personage, who was Prior of
Kilmainham, and for several years served the office of Lord Justice of
Ireland, in Holinshed's <em>Chronicles of Ireland</em>, sub anno 1325, <em>et
seq.</em>: also in "The Annals of Ireland," in the second volume of Gibson's
<em>Camden</em>, 3rd edition, sub eod. anno. He was nearly related to the lady
Alice Kettle, and her son William Utlawe, al. Outlaw; against whom that
singular charge of sorcery was brought by Richard Lederede, Bishop of
Ossory. The account of this charge is so curious that, for the benefit
of those readers of "N. &amp; Q." who may not have the means of referring to
the books above cited, I am tempted to extract it from Holinshed:</p>

<blockquote><p>"In these daies lived, in the Diocese of Ossorie, the Ladie
Alice Kettle, whome the Bishop ascited to purge hir selfe of the
fame of inchantment and witchcraft imposed unto hir, and to one
Petronill and Basill, hir complices. She was charged to have
nightlie conference with a spirit called Robin Artisson, to
whome she sacrificed in the high waie nine red cocks, and nine
peacocks' eies. Also, that she swept the streets of Kilkennie
betweene compleine and twilight, raking all the filth towards
the doores of hir sonne William Outlaw, murmuring and muttering
secretlie with hir selfe these words:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i0'>"'To the house of William my sonne</p>
<p>Hie all the wealth of Kilkennie towne.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>"At the first conviction, they abjured and did penance; but
shortlie after, they were found in relapse, and then was
Petronill burnt at Kilkennie: the other twaine might not be
heard of. She, at the hour of hir death, accused the said
William as privie to their sorceries, whome the bishop held in
durance nine weeks; forbidding his keepers to eat or to drinke
with him, or to speake to him more than once in the daie. But at
length, thorough the sute and instance of Arnold le Powre, then
seneschall of Kilkennie, he was delivered, and after corrupted
with bribes the seneschall to persecute the bishop: so that he
thrust him into prison for three moneths. In rifling the closet
of the ladie, they found a wafer of sacramentall bread, having
the divel's name stamped thereon insteed of Jesus Christ's; and
a pipe of ointment, wherewith she greased a staffe, upon which
she ambled and gallopped thorough thicke and thin when and in
what maner she listed. This businesse about these witches
troubled all the state of Ireland the more; for that the ladie
was supported by certeine of the nobilitie, and lastlie conveied
over into England; since which time it could never be understood
what became of hir."</p></blockquote>

<p>Roger Outlawe, the Prior of Kilmainham, was made Lord Justice for the
first time in 1327. The Bishop of Ossory was then seeking his revenge on
Arnold le Powre, for he had given information against him as being&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Convented and convicted in his consistorie of certeine
hereticall opinions; but because the beginning of Powres
accusation concerned the justice's kinsman, and the bishop was
mistrusted to prosecute his owne wrong, and the person of the
man, rather than the fault, a daie was limited for the
justifieing of the bill, the partie being apprehended and
respited thereunto. This dealing the bishop (who durst not
stirre out of<span class='pagenum'><a id="page386" name="page386">{386}</a></span> Kilkennie to prosecute his accusation) was
reputed parciall: and when by meanes hereof the matter hanged in
suspense, he infamed the said prior as an abettor and favourer
of Arnold's heresie. The Prior submitted himselfe to the trial."</p></blockquote>

<p>Proclamation was made, "That it should be lawful for anie man ... to
accuse, &amp;c. the Lord Justice; but none came." In the end, six
inquisitors were appointed to examine the bishops and other persons, and
they&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"All with universal consent deposed for the Prior, affirming
that (to their judgements) he was a zelous and a faithfull child
of the Catholike Church. In the meane time, Arnold le Powre, the
prisoner, deceased in the castell; and because he stood
unpurged, long he laie unburied."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1332, William Outlawe is said to have been Prior of Kilmainham, and
lieutenant of John Lord Darcie, Lord Justice.</p>

<p>This Bishop of Ossorie, Richard Lederede, was a minorite of London: he
had a troubled episcopate, and was long in banishment in England. I have
met with his name in the Register of Adam de Orlton, Bishop of
Winchester, where he is recorded as assisting that prelate in some of
his duties, <small>A.D.</small> 1336. He died however peaceably in his see, and was a
benefactor to his cathedral. (See Ware's <em>History of Ireland</em>.)</p>

<p class='author'>W. H. G.</p>

<p class='location'>Winchester.</p>

<p class='note'>[It may be added, that much information respecting both Roger
Outlawe and the trial of Alice Kyteler would be found in the
interesting volume published by the Camden society in 1842,
under the editorship of Mr. Wright, entitled <em>Proceedings
against Dame Alice Kyteler, prosecuted for Sorcery in 1324</em>.]</p>

<p>Your correspondent <span class="smcap">H. T. Ellacombe</span> asks who this Roger Outlawe was, and
expresses his surprise that a prior of a religious house should "sit as
<em lang='la'>locum tenens</em> of a judge in a law court."</p>

<p>But the words <span lang= 'la'>"tenens locum Johannis Darcy le cosyn justiciarii
Hiberni&aelig;"</span> do not imply that Outlawe sat as <em lang='la'>locum tenens</em> of a judge in
a law court. For this Sir John Darcy was Lord Justice, or Lord
Lieutenant (as we would now say), of Ireland, and Roger Outlawe was his
<em lang='la'>locum tenens</em>.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, was more common at that period than for ecclesiastics
to be judges in law courts; and it happens that this very Roger was Lord
Chancellor of Ireland in 1321 to 1325, and again, 1326&mdash;1330: again,
1333: again (a fourth time), 1335: and a fifth time in 1339: for even
then, as now, we were cursed in Ireland by perpetual changes of
administration and of law officers, so that we have scarcely had any
uniform practice, and our respect for law has been proportionally small.</p>

<p>Sir John Darcy was Lord Justice, or Lord Lieutenant, in 1322, in 1324,
in 1328 (in which year Roger Outlawe was his <em lang='la'>locum tenens</em> during his
absence), in 1322, and on to 1340.</p>

<p>Roger Outlawe was Lord Justice, either in his own right or as <em lang='la'>locum
tenens</em> for others, in 1328, 1330, and 1340, in which last year he died
in office. His death is thus recorded in Clyn's <em>Annals</em> (edited by Dean
Butler for the Irish Arch&aelig;ological Society), p. 29.:</p>

<blockquote><p lang='la'>"Item die Martis, in crastino beat&aelig; Agath&aelig; virginis, obiit

<h3><a id='Prospectus' name='Prospectus'>PROSPECTUS TO CIBBER'S "LIVES OF THE POETS."</a></h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. v., pp. 25. 65.; Vol. vii., p. 341.)</p>

<p>I am obliged to <span class="smcap">Dr. Rimbault</span> for noticing, what had escaped me, that
this Prospectus has been reprinted in the <em>Censura Literaria</em>, vol. vi.
p. 352. With respect to my ground for attributing it to Johnson, it
will, I think, be obvious enough to any one who reads my remarks, that
it was on the internal evidence alone, on which, as every one is aware,
many additions have been made to his acknowledged compositions. Your
correspondent C., with whom I always regret to differ, is so far at
variance with me as to state it as his opinion that "nothing can be less
like Johnson's peculiar style," and refers me to a note, with which I
was perfectly familiar, to show&mdash;but which I must say I cannot see that
it does in the slightest degree&mdash;"that it is impossible that Johnson
could have written this Prospectus." Another correspondent, whose
communication I am unable immediately to refer to, likewise recorded his
dissent from my conclusion. Next follows <span class="smcap">Dr. Rimbault</span>, whom I understand
to differ from me also, and who says (but where is the authority for the
statement?) "Haslewood believed it to have been the production of
Messrs. Cibber and Shields." I have every respect for Haslewood as a
diligent antiquary, but I confess I do not attach much weight to his
opinion on a question of critical taste or nice discrimination of style.
I had, as I have observed, assigned the Prospectus to Dr. Johnson on the
internal evidence alone; but since it appeared in "N. &amp; Q." I have
become aware of an important corroboration of my opinion in a copy of
Cibber's <em>Lives</em> which formerly belonged to Isaac Reed, and which I have
recently purchased. At the beginning of the first volume he has pasted
in the Prospectus, and under it is the following note in his<span class='pagenum'><a id="page387" name="page387">{387}</a></span>
handwriting: "The above advertisement was written or revised by Dr.
Johnson.&mdash;J. R." Reed's general correctness and capacity of judging in
literary matters are too well known to render it necessary for me to
enlarge upon them; and with this support I am quite content to leave the
point in issue between your correspondents and myself to the decision of
that part of your readers who take an interest in similar literary
questions.</p>

<p>It will be observed that I have confined myself in my remarks to the
Prospectus exclusively. The authorship of the <em>Lives</em> themselves is
another question, and a very curious one, and not, by any means, as your
correspondent C. appears to think, "settled." Perhaps I may, on a future
occasion, trouble you with some remarks upon the <em>Lives</em> in detail,
endeavouring to assign the respective portions to the several
contributors.</p>

<h3><a id='Pic-nic' name='Pic-nic'>PIC-NIC.</a></h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. vii., p. 23.)</p>

<p>As I consider that the true origin of <em>pic-nic</em> remains yet to be
discovered, permit me to try and trace the word through France into
Italy, and to endeavour to show that the land with the "fatal gift of
beauty" was its birthplace; and that when the Medici married into
France, the august ladies probably imported, together with fans, gloves,
and poisons, a pastime which, under the name of <em lang='fr'>pique-nique</em>, became,
as Leroux says in his <em lang='fr'>Dictionnaire Comique</em>,
<span lang='fr'>"un divertissement fort &agrave;
la mode &agrave; Paris."</span></p>

<p>I will not occupy space by quoting the article "at length" from Leroux,
but the substance is this:&mdash;Persons of quality, of both sexes, who
wished to enjoy themselves, and feast together, either in the open air
or in the house of one of the number, imposed upon each one the task of
bringing some particular article, or doing some particular duty in
connexion with the feast. And to show how stringent was the expression
<em lang='fr'>pique-nique</em> in imposing a specific task, Leroux quotes <span lang='fr'>"consid&eacute;rant
que chacun avait besoin de ses pi&egrave;ces, pronon&ccedil;a un <em>arr&ecirc;t</em> de
pique-nique."</span> (<em lang='fr'>Rec. de Pi&egrave;c. Com.</em>)</p>

<p>Thus, I think Leroux and also Cotgrave show that the word <em lang='fr'>pique-nique</em>
involves the idea of a task, or particular office, undertaken by each
individual for the general benefit.</p>

<p>Let us now go to Italian, and look at the word <em lang='it'>nicchia</em>. Both from
Alberti and from Baretti we find it to bear the meaning of "a charge, a
duty, or an employment;" and if before this word we place the adjective
<em lang='it'>piccola</em>, we have <em lang='it'>piccola nicchia</em>, "a small task, or trifling service
to be performed." Now I think no one can fail to see the identity of the
<em>meanings</em> of the expressions <em lang='it'>piccola nicchia</em> and <em lang='fr'>pique-nique</em>; but
it remains to show how the words themselves may be identical. Those who
have been in the habit of reading much of the older Italian authors
(subsequent to Boccacio) will bear me out in my statement of the
frequency of contraction of words in familiar use: the plays,
particularly, show it, from the dialogues in Machiavelli or Goldoni to
the libretto of a modern opera; so much as to render it very probable
that <em lang='it'>piccola nicchia</em> might stand as <em>picc' nicc'</em>, just as we
ourselves have been in the habit of degrading <em>scandalum magnatum</em> into
<em>scan. mag.</em> It only remains now to carry this <em>picc' nicc'</em> into
France, and, according to what is usual in Gallicising Italian words, to
change the <em>c</em> or <em>ch</em> into <em>que</em>, to have what I started with, viz. the
<em lang='fr'>divertissement</em> concerning which Leroux enlarges, and in which, I am
afraid, it may be said I have followed his example.</p>

<p>However, I consider the <em>Decameron</em> of Boccacio as a probable period
where the temporary queen of the day would impose the <em lang='fr'>arr&ecirc;t</em> of
<em lang='fr'>pique-nique</em> upon her subjects; and when I look over the engravings of
the manners and customs of the Italians of the Middle Ages, all
indicating the frequency of the <em lang='it'>al fresco</em> banquets, and find that
subsequently Watteau and Lancret revel in similar amusements in France,
where the personages of the <em lang='fr'>f&ecirc;te</em> manifestly wear Italian-fashioned
garments; and when we are taught that such parties of pleasure were
called <em lang='fr'>pique-niques</em>, I think it is fair to infer that the expression
is a Gallicised one from an Italian phrase of the same signification.</p>

<p>I do not know if it will be conceded that I have proved my case
<em>positively</em>, but I might go so far <em>negatively</em> as to show that in no
other European language can I find any word or words which, having a
similar sound, will bear an analysis of adaptation; and though there is
every probability that the custom of <em>pic-nic</em>ing obtained in preference
in the sunny south, there are few, I think, that would rush for an
explanation into the Eastern languages, on the plea that the Crusaders,
being in the habit of <em lang='it'>al fresco</em> banquetting, might have brought home
the expression <em>pic-nic</em>.</p>

<h3><a id='Peter_Sterry_and_Jeremiah_White' name='Peter_Sterry_and_Jeremiah_White'>PETER STERRY AND JEREMIAH WHITE.</a></h3>

<p class='center'>(Vol. iii., p. 38.)</p>

<p>Your correspondent's inquiry with respect to the missing MSS. of Peter
Sterry, which were intended to form a second volume of his posthumous
works, published without printer's name in 1710, 4to., and of which MSS.
a list is given in vol. i., does not seem to have led to any result. As
I feel equal interest with himself in every production of Sterry, I am
tempted again to repeat the Query, in the hope of some discovery being
made of these valuable remains. I have no doubt the editor of the
"Appearance of God to Man," and the other discourses printed in the
first volume, was R. Roach, who edited Jeremiah White's <em>Persuasion to
Moderation</em>, Lond., 1708, 8vo.; and afterwards published <em>The Great
Crisis</em>, and <em>The Imperial Standard of Messiah Triumphant</em>, 1727, 8vo.;
and probably Sterry's MSS. may be found if Roach's papers can be traced.
It is curious that a similar loss of MSS. seems to have occurred with
regard to several of the works of Jeremiah White, who, like Sterry, was
a chaplain of Cromwell (how well that great man knew how to select
them!), and, like Sterry, was of that admirable Cambridge theological
school which Whichcot, John Smith, and Cudworth have made so renowned.
Neither of these distinguished men have yet, that I am aware of, found
their way into any biographical dictionary. White is slightly noticed by
Calamy (vol. ii. p. 57.; vol. iv. p. 85.). Sterry, it appears, died on
Nov. 19, 1672. White survived him many years, and died in the
seventy-eighth year of his age, 1707. Of the latter, there is an
engraved portrait; of the former, none that I know of; nor am I aware of
the burial-place of either. The works which I have met with of Sterry
are his seven sermons preached before Parliament, &amp;c., and published in
different years; his <em>Rise, Race, and Royalty of the Kingdom of God in
the Soul of Man</em>, 1683, 4to.; his <em>Discourse of the Freedom of the Will</em>
(a title which does not by any means convey the character of the book),
Lond., 1675, fol.; and the 4to. before mentioned, being vol. i. of his
<em>Remains</em>, published in 1710. Of White I only knew a Funeral Sermon on
Mr. Francis Fuller; his <em>Persuasion to Moderation</em>, above noticed, which
is an enlargement of part of his preface to Sterry's <em>Rise, &amp;c.</em>; and
his <em>Treatise on the Restoration of all Things</em>, 1712, 8vo., which has
recently been republished by Dr. Thom. To his <em>Persuasion</em> is appended
an advertisement:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There being a design of publishing the rest of Mr. White's
works, any that have either Letters or other Manuscripts of his
by them are desired to communicate them to Mr. John Tarrey,
distiller, at the Golden Fleece, near Shadwick Dock."</p></blockquote>

<p>This design, with the exception of the publication of <em>The Restoration</em>,
seems to have proved abortive. White entertained many opinions in common
with Sterry, which he advocates with great power. He does not however,
like his fellow chaplain, soar into the pure empyrean of theology with
unfailing pinions. Sterry has frequently sentences which Milton might
not have been ashamed to own. His <em>Discourse of the Freedom of the Will</em>
is a noble performance, and the preface will well bear a comparison with
Cudworth's famous sermon on the same subject.</p>

<p><em>Colouring Collodion Portraits.</em>&mdash;I shall be obliged if any brother
photographer will kindly inform me, through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," the
best method of colouring collodion portraits and views in a style
similar to the hyalotypes shown at the Great Exhibition.</p>

<p>We country photographers are much indebted to <span class="smcap">Dr. Diamond</span> for the
valuable information we have obtained through his excellent papers in
"N. &amp; Q.," and perceiving he is shortly about to give us the benefit of
his experience in a compact form, under the modest title of
<em>Photographic Notes</em>, I suggest that, if one of his Notes should contain
the best method of colouring collodion proofs, so as to render them
applicable for dissolving views, &amp;c., he will be conferring a benefit on
many of your subscribers; and, as one of your oldest, allow me to
subscribe myself</p>

<p class='author'>Photo.</p>


<p><em>On some Points in the Collodion Process.</em>&mdash;In your impression of this
day's date (Vol. vii., p. 363.), the Rev. <span class="smcap">J. L. Sisson</span> desires the
opinion of other photographers relative to lifting the plate with the
film of collodion up and down several times in the bath of nit. silv.
solution; and as my experience on this point is diametrically opposed to
his own, I venture to state it with the view of eliciting a discussion.</p>

<p>The <em>evenness</em> of the film is not at all dependent upon this practice;
but its sensibility to light appears to be considerably increased.</p>

<p>The plate, after being plunged in, should be allowed to repose quietly
from twenty to thirty minutes, <em>and then rapidly</em> slid in and out
several times, until the liquid flows off in one continuous and even
<em>sheet</em> of liquid; and this also has a beneficial effect in washing off
any little particles of collodion, dust, oxide, or any foreign matter
which, if adherent, would form centres of chemical action, and cause
spottiness in the negative.<span class='pagenum'><a id="page389" name="page389">{389}</a></span></p>

<p>I find that the plate is more sensitive also, if not exposed before all
the exciting fluid that can be <em>drained off</em> is got rid of; that is,
while still quite moist, but without any <em>flowing</em> liquid.</p>

<p>As to redipping the plate before development, it is, I believe, <em>in
general</em> useless; but when the plate has got <em>very</em> dry it may be dipped
again, but should be then <em>well drained</em> before the developing solution
is applied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F. Maxwell Lyte</span> (p. 364.) quotes the price of the purest iodide of
potassium at 1<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> per oz. I should be glad to know where it can
be obtained, as I find the price constantly varies, and upon the last
occasion I paid 4<em>s.</em> per oz., and I think never less than 1<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L. Merritt</span> will probably succeed in applying the cement for a glass
bath thus:&mdash;Place the pieces of glass upon wood of any kind in an oven
with the door open until he can only just handle them; then, with a roll
of the cement, melting the end in the flame of a spirit-lamp, apply it
as if for sealing a letter. This should be done as quickly as possible.
The glasses may then be passed over the flame of the lamp (in contact
with it), so as to raise the temperature, until the cement is quite soft
and nearly boiling (this can be done without heating the parts near the
fingers); and while hot the two separate pieces should be applied by
putting one down on a piece of wood covered with flannel, and pressing
the other with any wooden instrument: metal in contact would cause an
instantaneous fracture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Merritt</span>'s difficulty with the developing solutions depends most
probably in the case of the pyrogallic acid mixture not having enough
acetic acid. The protonitrate of iron, if made according to <span class="smcap">Dr.
Diamond</span>'s formula, does <em>not</em> require any acetic acid, and flows quite
readily; but the protosulphate solution requires a bath, and the same
solution may be used over and over again.</p>

<p class='location'>London, April 9, 1853.</p>


<p><em>Economical Iodizing Process.</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr. Maxwell Lyte</span> is probably as good a
judge as myself, as to where any weak point or difficulty is found in
iodizing paper with the carbonate of potass: if any chemical is likely
to be the cause of unusual activity, it is the carbonic acid, and not
the cyanide of potash. I still continue to use that formula, and have
not iodized paper with any other: though I have made some variations
which may perhaps be of use. I found that the nitrate of potash is
almost the same in its effects as the carbonate. I would as soon use the
one as the other; but the state I conceive to be the most effective, is
the diluted liquor potass&aelig;: that would be with iodine about the same
state as the iodide of potash, but hitherto I have not tried it, though
mean to do so.</p>

<p>I am not quite certain as to whether, theoretically, this position is
right; but I find in iodide of potash, and in the above formula, that
the iodine is absorbed in greater quantities by the silver, than the
alkaline potash by the nitric acid. Thus, by using a solution for some
time, it will at last contain but very little iodine at all, and not
enough for the purpose of the photographer; hence it requires renewing.
And I have lately observed that paper is much more effective, in every
way, if it is floated on free iodine twice before it is used in the
camera, viz. once when it is made, and again when it is dry: the last
time containing a little bromine water and glacial acetic acid. It
appears to me that the paper will absorb its proper dose of iodine
better when dry, and the glacial acetic acid will set free any small
amount of alkaline potash there may be on the surface; so that it will
not embrown on applying gallic acid. By using the ammonio-nitrate of
silver in iodizing, and proceeding as above, I find it all I can wish as
far as regards the power of my camera. With this paper I can use an
aperture of half an inch diameter, and take anything in the shade and
open air in five or six minutes, in the sun in less time. The yellow
colour also comes off better in the hypo. sulph.</p>

<p>I think <span class="smcap">Mr. Maxwell Lyte</span> has made a mistake as to the price he quotes:
about here I cannot get any iodide of potash under 2<em>s.</em> per ounce, and
the five grains to the ounce added to the common dose of nitrate of
silver is hardly worth speaking of; it would amount, in fact, to about
fifteen grains in a quire of Whatman's paper,&mdash;no great hardship,
because many use much higher doses of silver for iodizing; forty grains
to the ounce is not uncommonly used, but I believe twenty-five grains
quite enough.</p>

<p>I presume, in <span class="smcap">Sir Wm. Newton</span>'s mode of treating positives, the acid of
the alum decomposes the alkali of the hypo. sulph. And it would be, I
suppose, better for the picture, if its state were entirely neutral when
put away or framed; but if alum is added, acid must remain, since <span class="smcap">Sir
Wm.</span> says it combines with the size. What I should imagine is, that the
idea is good; but experience can only decide if the picture is better
put away in an acid condition. I should think there are more available
acids for the purpose, for alum has an injurious effect upon colour; and
a positive is nothing but colour, the organic matter of the paper
stained as it were by the silver: for, after all its washings and
application of re-agents, no silver can possibly remain in the paper.
The safest state therefore of putting away ought to be ascertained and
decided upon; as it is no use doing them if they fade, or even lose
their tones.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The iodized ammonio-nitrate paper will not bear exposure to the
sun; it will keep any<span class='pagenum'><a id="page390" name="page390">{390}</a></span> length of time, but should be kept in a paper,
and away from any considerable degree of light.</p>

<p><em>Dutensiana</em> (Vol. vi., p. 376.; Vol. vii., p. 26.).&mdash;The following
statement, extracted from Qu&eacute;rard's <em lang='fr'>France Litt&eacute;raire</em>, <span lang='la'>sub voce</span>
Dutens, will account for the discrepancies mentioned by your
correspondents with reference to the works of Louis Dutens.</p>

<p>Dutens published three volumes of <em>Memoirs</em>, which he afterwards
committed to the flames, out of consideration for certain living
characters. He then published, in three volumes, his <em lang='fr'>M&eacute;moires d'un
Voyageur qui se repose</em>, the two first containing the author's life, and
the third being the <em>Dutensiana</em>.</p>

<p>Your correspondent W. (Vol. vi., p. 376.) says that Dutens published at
Geneva, in six volumes 4to., with prefaces, the entire works of
Leibnitz. This statement is thus qualified by the <em lang='fr'>Biographie
Universelle</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p lang='fr'>"L. Dutens est l'Editeur de <em>Leibnitii opera omnia</em>, mais c'est
&agrave; tort que quelques bibliographes lui attribuent les

included in the list of Dutens' <em>Works</em> given by Lowndes.</p>

<p>This is explained by the fact that the work, originally published under
the title of <em lang='fr'>Correspondence intercept&eacute;e</em>, was afterwards embodied in
the <em lang='fr'>M&eacute;moires d'un Voyageur</em>. Lowndes seems to have had no knowledge of

<p>If, however, A. C.'s Query be not limited to slabs in the open air, he
will probably be interested by the following, copied by me from the
floors of the respective churches, which are all in this neighbourhood.
The first is from the unused church of St. John at Laughton-le-Morthing,
near Roche Abbey, and is, according to Mr. Hunter, one of the earliest
specimens of a monumental inscription in the vernacular:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Here lyeth Robt. Dinningto' and Alis his wyfe. Robert dyed &#299;

<p>The next three are partly pewed over; but the uncovered parts are
perfectly legible. The first two are from Tankersley, the third from
Wentworth:</p>

<blockquote lang='la'><p>"Hic jacet dn&#773;s Thomas Toykyl ... die mensis Aprilis anno

the <em>Proceedings of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire</em>,
1851-2, there is mention of a similar tradition to that quoted by your
correspondent J. J. S.</p>

<p>Speaking of the cemetery of Kilgrimol, two miles on the south shore from
Blackpool, the learned gentleman says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The ditch and cross have disappeared, either obliterated by the
sand, or overwhelmed by the inroads of the sea; but, with
tradition, the locality is a favourite still. The <em lang='la'>superstitio
loci</em> marks the site: 'The church,' it says, 'was swallowed up
by an earthquake, together with the Jean la Cairne of Stonyhill;
but on Christmas eve every one, since that time, on bending his
ear to the ground, may distinguish clearly its bells pealing
most merrily.'"</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Spontaneous Combustion</em> (Vol. vii., p. 286.).&mdash;I presume H. A. B.'s
question refers to the human body only, because the possibility of
spontaneous combustion in several other substances is, I believe, not
disputed. On that of the human body Taylor says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The hypothesis of those who advocate <em>spontaneous</em> combustion,
is, it appears to me, perfectly untenable. So far as I have been
able to examine this subject, there is not a single
well-authenticated instance of such an event occurring: in the
cases reported which are worthy of any credit, a candle or some
other ignited body has been at hand, and the accidental ignition
of the clothes was highly probable, if not absolutely certain."</p></blockquote>

<p>He admits that, under certain circumstances, the human body, though in
general "highly difficult of combustion," may acquire increased
combustible properties. But this is another question<span class='pagenum'><a id="page392" name="page392">{392}</a></span> from that of the
possibility of its purely spontaneous combustion. (See Taylor's <em>Medical
Jurisprudence</em>, pages 424-7. edit. 1846.)</p>

<p><em>Muffs worn by Gentlemen</em> (Vol. vi., <em>passim</em>; Vol. vii., p. 320.).&mdash;The
writer of a series of papers in the <em>New Monthly Magazine</em>, entitled
"Parr in his later Years," thus (vol. xvi. p. 482.) describes the
appearance of that learned Theban:</p>

<blockquote><p>"He had on his dressing-gown, which I think was flannel, or
cotton, and the skirts dangled round his ankles. Over this he
had drawn his great-coat, buttoned close; and his hands, for he
had been attacked with erysipelas not long before, were kept
warm in a <em>silk muff</em>, not much larger than the poll of a common
hat."</p></blockquote>

<p>In an anonymous poetical pamphlet (<em>Thoughts in Verse concerning
Feasting and Dancing</em>, 12mo. London, 1800), is a little poem, entitled
"The Muff," in the course of which the following lines occur:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p class='i0'>"A time there was (that time is now no more,</p>
<p>At least in England 'tis not now observ'd!)</p>
<p>When muffs were worn by <em>beaux</em> as well as belles.</p>
<p>Scarce has a century of time elaps'd,</p>
<p>Since such an article was much in vogue;</p>
<p>Which, when it was not on the arm sustain'd,</p>
<p>Hung, pendant by a silken ribbon loop</p>
<p>From button of the coat of well-dress'd beau.</p>
<p>'Tis well for manhood that the use has ceased!</p>
<p>For what to <em>woman</em> might be well allow'd,</p>
<p>As suited to the softness of her sex,</p>
<p>Would seem effeminate and wrong in <em>man</em>."</p>

<p><em>Crescent</em> (Vol. vii., p. 235.).&mdash;In Judges, ch. viii. ver. 21., Gideon
is recorded to have taken away from Zeba and Zalmunna, kings of Midian,
"the ornaments that were on their camels' necks." The marginal
translation has "ornaments like the moon;" and in verse 24. it is stated
that the Midianites were <em>Ishmaelites</em>. If, therefore, it be borne in
mind that Mohammed was an Arabian, and that the Arabians were
Ishmaelites, we may perhaps be allowed to infer that the origin of the
use of the crescent was not as a symbol of Mohammed's religion, but that
it was adopted by his countrymen and followers from their ancestors, and
may be referred to at least as far back as 1249 <small>B.C.</small>, when Zeba and
Zalmunna were slain, and when it seems to have been the customary
ornament of the Ishmaelites.</p>

<p><em>The Author of "The Family Journal"</em> (Vol. vii., p. 313.).&mdash;The author
of the very clever series of papers in the <em>New Monthly Magazine</em>, to
which <span class="smcap">Mr. Bede</span> refers, is Mr. Leigh Hunt. The particular one in which
Swift's Latin-English is quoted, has been republished in a charming
little volume, full of original thinking, expressed with the felicity of
genius, called <em>Table Talk</em>, and published in 1851 by Messrs. Smith and
Elder, of Cornhill.</p>

<p><em>Parochial Libraries</em> (Vol. vi., p. 432. &amp;c.).&mdash;I fear that there is
little doubt that these collections of books have very often been
unfairly dispersed. It is by no means uncommon, in looking over the
stock of an old divinity bookseller, to meet with works with the names
of parochial libraries written in them. I have met with many such: they
appear chiefly to have consisted of the works of the Fathers, and of our
seventeenth century divines. As a case in point, I recollect, about ten
years since, being at a sale at the rectory of Reepham, Norfolk,
consequent upon the death of the rector, and noticing several works with
the inscription "Reepham Church Library" written inside: these were sold
indiscriminately with the rector's books. At this distance of time I
cannot recollect the titles of many of the works; but I perfectly
remember a copy of Sir H. Savile's edition of <em>Chrysostom</em>, 8 vols.
folio; <em>Constantini Lexicon</em>, folio; and some pieces of Bishop Andrewes.
These were probably intended for the use of the rector, as in the case
reported by your correspondent <span class="smcap">Cheverells</span> (Vol. vii., p. 369.).</p>

<p>I may also mention having seen a small parochial library of old divinity
kept in the room over the porch in the church of Sutton Courtenay, near
Abingdon, Berks. With the history and purpose of this collection I am
unacquainted.</p>

<p><em>Sidney as a Christian Name</em> (Vol. vii., pp. 39. 318.).&mdash;Lady Morgan the
authoress was, before her marriage, Miss <em>Sidney</em> Owenson. See Chambers'
<em>Encyclop. of Eng. Lit.</em>, ii. 580.</p>

<p class='author'>P. J. F. Gantillon, B.A.</p>


<p><em>"Rather"</em> (Vol. vii., p. 282.).&mdash;The root of the word <em>rather</em> is
Celtic, in which language <em>raith</em> means "inclination," "on account of,"
"for the sake of," &amp;c. Thus, in the line quoted from Chaucer,</p>

<blockquote><p>
"What aileth you so <em>rath&egrave;</em> for to arise,"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it clearly signifies "what aileth you that you <em>so incline</em> to arise,"
and so on, in the various uses to which the comparative of the word is
put: as, I had rather do so and so, <em>i. e.</em> "I feel <em>more inclined</em>;" I
am rather tired, <em>i. e.</em> "I am fatigued <em>on account of</em> the walk," &amp;c. I
am glad that you are come, the rather that I have work for you to do,
<em>i. e.</em> "<em>more on account of</em> the work which I have for you to do, or
<em>for the sake</em> of the work," &amp;c. Any obscurity that is attached to the
use of the word, has arisen from the abuse of it, or rather from its
right signification being not properly understood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id="page393" name="page393">{393}</a></span><em>Lady High Sheriff</em> (Vol. vii., pp. 236. 340.).&mdash;Another instance may be
seen in Foss's <em>Judges of England</em>, vol. ii. p. 51.&mdash;In speaking of
Reginald de Cornhill, who held the Sheriffalty of Kent from 5 Richard I.
to 5 Henry III., he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"His seat at Minster, in the Isle of Thanet, acquired the name
of 'Sheriff's Court,' which it still retains; and he himself,
discontinuing his own name, was styled Reginald le Viscount,
even his widow being designated Vicecomitessa Cantii."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Nugget</em> (Vol. vi., p. 171.; Vol. vii., pp. 143. 272.).&mdash;Nugget <em>may</em> be
derived from the Persian, but it is also used in Scotland, and means a
lump,&mdash;a nugget of sugar, for instance. And as Scotchmen are to be found
everywhere, its importation into Australia and California is easily
accounted for.</p>

<p><em>Epigrams</em> (Vol. vii., p. 180.).&mdash;I beg to confirm the statement of
<span class="smcap">Scrapiana</span> as to the reading John instead of Thomas in the line</p>

<blockquote><p>
"'Twixt Footman John and Dr. Toe."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may not be generally known that this epigram came from the pen of
Reginald Heber, late Bishop of Calcutta, who was then a commoner of
Brazenoze College, and who wrote that extremely clever satire called
<em>The Whippiad</em> of which the same Dr. Toe (the Rev. Henry Halliwell, Dean
and Tutor) was the hero. <em>The Whippiad</em> was printed for the first time a
few years ago, in <em>Blackwood's Magazine</em>.</p>

<p>I fancy the other facetious epigram given by <span class="smcap">Scrapiana</span> has no connexion
with this, but was merely inserted on the same page as being "similis
materi&aelig;."</p>

<p><em>Portrait of Pope</em> (Vol. vii., p. 294.).&mdash;Dr. Falconer's portrait of
Pope could not have been painted by <em>Joseph</em> Wright of Derby, as that
celebrated artist was only fourteen when Pope died; consequently, the
anecdote told of the painter, and of his meeting the poet at dinner,
must apply to the artist named by Dr. Falconer, and of course correctly,
<em>Edward</em> Wright.</p>

<p><em>Passage in Coleridge</em> (Vol. vii., p. 330.).&mdash;The paper referred to by
Coleridge will be found in the <em>Transactions of the Manchester Literary
and Philosophical Society</em>, vol. iii. p. 463. It is the "Description of
a Glory," witnessed by Dr. Haygarth on Feb. 13th, 1780, when "returning
to Chester, and ascending the mountain which forms the eastern boundary
of the Vale of Clwyd." As your correspondent asks for a copy of the
description, the volume being scarce, I will give the following extract:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I was struck with the peculiar appearance of a very white
shining cloud, that lay remarkably close to the ground. The sun
was nearly setting, but shone extremely bright. I walked up to
the cloud, and my shadow was projected into it; when a very
unexpected and beautiful scene was presented to my view. The
head of my shadow was surrounded, at some distance, by a circle
of various colours; whose centre appeared to be near the
situation of the eye, and whose circumference extended to the
shoulders. The circle was complete, except what the shadow of my
body intercepted. It resembled, very exactly, what in pictures
is termed a <em>glory</em>, around the head of our Saviour and of
saints: not, indeed, that luminous radiance which is painted
close to the head, but an arch of concentric colours. As I
walked forward, this <em>glory</em> approached or retired, just as the
inequality of the ground shortened or lengthened my shadow."</p></blockquote>

<p>A plate "by the writer's friend, Mr. Falconer," accompanies the paper.</p>

<p>In my copy of the <em>Transactions</em>, the following MS. note is attached to
this paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>"See Juan's and De Ulloa's <em>Voyage to South America</em>, book vi.
ch. ix., where ph&aelig;nomena, nearly similar, are described."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Burn at Croydon</em> (Vol. vii., p. 283.).&mdash;This seems to be of the same
nature as the "nailburns" mentioned by Halliwell (<em>Arch. Dict.</em>). In
Lambarde's <em>Perambulation of Kent</em>, p. 221., 2nd edit., mention is made
of a stream running under ground. But it seems very difficult to account
for these phenomena, and any geologist who would give a satisfactory
explanation of these <em>burns</em>, <em>nailburns</em>, subterraneous streams, and
those which in Lincolnshire are termed "blow wells," would confer a
favour on several of your readers.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

<p>Our learned, grave, and potent cotemporary, <em>The Quarterly Review</em>, has,
in the number just issued, a very pleasant gossiping article on <em>The Old
Countess of Desmond</em>. The writer, who pays "N. &amp; Q." a passing
compliment for which we are obliged, although he very clearly
establishes the fact of the existence of a Countess of Desmond, who was
well known and remarkable for her <em>extreme</em> longevity, certainly does
not prove that the old Countess actually lived to the great age of 140
years.</p>

<p>The publisher of <em>Men of the Time, or Sketches of Living Notables</em>, has
just put forth a new edition of what will eventually become a valuable
and interesting little volume. There are so many difficulties in the way
of making such a book accurate and complete, that it is no wonder if
this second edition, although it contains upwards of sixty additional
articles, has yet many omissions. Its present aspect is too political.
Men of the pen are too lightly passed over, unless they are professed
journalists; many of the greatest scholars of the present day being
entirely omitted. This must and doubtless will be amended.</p>

<p>It is with great regret that we have to announce the death of one whose
facile pen and well-stored memory furnished many a pleasant note to our
readers,&mdash;J. R. of Cork, under which signature that able scholar, and
kindly hearted gentleman, <span class="smcap">Mr. James Roche</span>, happily designated by Father
Prout the "Roscoe of Cork," was pleased to contribute to our columns.
<em>The Athen&aelig;um</em> well observes that "his death will leave a blank in the
intellectual society of the South of Ireland, and the readers of 'N. &amp;
Q.' will miss his genial and instructive gossip on books and men."</p>

<p><em>The Photographic Society</em> is rapidly increasing. The meeting on the 7th
for the exhibition and explanation of cameras was a decided failure,
from the want of due preparation; but that failure will be fully
compensated by the promised exhibition of them in the rooms of the
<em>Society of Arts</em>. While on the subject of Photography, we may call the
attention of our readers to a curious paper on Photographic Engraving,
in <em>The Athen&aelig;um</em> of Saturday last, by a gentleman to whom the art is
already under so much obligation, Mr. Fox Talbot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<em>Wellington, his Character, his Actions, and his
Writings</em>, by Jules Maurel, is well described by its editor, Lord
Ellesmere, as "among the most accurate, discriminating, and felicitous
tributes which have evaluated from any country in any language to the
memory of the great Duke."&mdash;<em>Temple Bar, the City Golgotha, a Narrative
of the Historical Occurrences of a Criminal Character associated with
the present Bar</em>, by a Member of the Inner Temple. A chatty and
anecdotical history of this last remaining gate of the city, under
certainly its most revolting aspect. The sketch will doubtless be
acceptable, particularly to London antiquaries.</p>
